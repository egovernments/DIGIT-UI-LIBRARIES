# digit ui components

Welcome to the Digit UI Component Library Repository! This repository houses core component libraries for building user interfaces (UI) using both React and Flutter. The components provided here are designed to be reusable, customizable, and easily integrable into your projects.

## React Components

The `react` directory contains a collection of reusable UI components built specifically for React applications. These components are written in JavaScript  and follow best practices for React development. They are designed to provide consistent styling, functionality, and behavior across different React projects.

### Getting Started

To use the React components in your project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `react` directory.
2. Import the component(s) into your React components.
3. Customize the components as needed to suit your project requirements.
4. Enjoy the benefits of reusable UI components in your React application!

### Documentation

Explore the documentation and examples of React components in [Storybook](https://unified-dev.digit.org/storybook). Storybook provides an interactive environment to view and interact with the components, along with detailed [documentation](https://core.digit.org/v/2.9-lts/guides/developer-guide/ui-developer-guide/digit-ui/ui-components/ui-components-standardisation/digit-ui-core-react-components)

## Flutter Components

The `flutter` directory contains a set of reusable UI components tailored for Flutter applications. These components are written in Dart and are compatible with both Android and iOS platforms. They adhere to Flutter's widget architecture and provide a consistent look and feel for your Flutter apps.

### Getting Started

To incorporate the Flutter components into your project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `flutter` directory.
2. Copy the desired component(s) into your Flutter project's `lib` directory.
3. Import the component(s) into your Flutter Dart files.
4. Utilize the components within your Flutter UI hierarchy.
5. Customize the components to match your app's design language and functionality.
6. Experience the ease of building beautiful UIs with reusable Flutter components!
